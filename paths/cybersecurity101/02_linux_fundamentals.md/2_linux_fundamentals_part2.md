# Linux Fundamentals Part 2
Continue your learning Linux journey with part two. You will be learning how to log in to a Linux machine using SSH, how to advance your commands, file system interaction.

## Task 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the second part of the reworked "Linux Fundamentals" series. We'll be applying our knowledge from the first installment in this series, so I highly recommend you completing that room before proceeding further.

In part 2, we'll be ditching the in-browser functionality and help you get started in what is a fundamental skill in being able to login to and control the terminals of remote machines. Not only this, but the room will also have you:

- Unlocking the potential of your first few commands by introducing you to using flags and arguments
- Advancing your knowledge of the filesystem to perform some more useful commands such as copying and moving files
- Discovering how access to files and folders is managed and how we can determine our access.
- Running your first few scripts and executables!
