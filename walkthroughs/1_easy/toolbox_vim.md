# Toolbox: Vim
Learn vim, a universal text editor that can be incredibly powerful when used properly. From basic text editing to editing of binary files, Vim can be an important arsenal in a security toolkit.

## Task 1
Lets get started!

To check whether Vim is installed:

    - Launch a Terminal Window

    - Type "vim"

If you're looking at the Vim splash page 

![vim splash page](https://i.redd.it/jxykk7sdrezy.png)

Then you're in luck! 

Otherwise type:

**Debian-Based Distributions:**
`sudo apt install vim`

**Arch-Based Distributions:**
`sudo pacman -S vim`

**Fedora-Based Distributions:**
`sudo dnf install vim-enhanced`

**Windows:**
Go to: https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc - 
Download and install the "self-installing-executable"

## Task 2

Lets get used to using Vim for basic text editing...

### Modes

There are three basic modes in Vim:

- **Command mode** is where you can run commands. This is the default mode in which Vim starts up
- **Insert mode** is where you insert i.e. write the text
- **Visual mode** is where you visually select a bunch of text so that you can run a command/operation only on that part of the text.

These form the pillars of navigating and using Vim. Try and answer the questions and work out how to begin creating a basic text document in Vim.

### Navigation

Now that you know how to start creating a text document, you're going to need to know how to navigate it.

- left
- right
- up
- down
- jump to the start of a word
- jump to the end of a word

Hint, focus on key clusters, not combinations of keys for this.

### Inserting Text

Now you're comfortable in basic typing and navigating the document, lets get into using vim in a more powerful way!

The shortcuts for appending and inserting are crucial, I suggest trying to implement them into your typing routine so that they really stick.


### FOR HELP WITH THE QUESTIONS

The easiest way to ask for help is to start with executing :help during a Vim session. This will drop us into the main help file which has an overview of the basics.

To get help with a specific command, we can provide that command as an argument to the :help command. By invoking :help gg, we learn more details about gg including that <C-home> does the same thing and that by providing a [count], we can use gg to jump anywhere in a file.
