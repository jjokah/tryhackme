## Web Fundamentals
The aim of this path is to teach you how to attack web applications. To successfully attack and exploit web applications, you need to understand how they work.

_Sections:_
1. How The Web Works
2. Introduction to Web Hacking
3. Burp Suite
4. Web Hacking Fundamentals 
5. OWASP Top 10 (2025)


## Web Application Pentesting
Every day you interact with web applications. Just reading the information here means you are using a web application! Understanding how to test web applications is a critical skill required by almost every pentester! Even if you want to specialise in testing other systems like networks or cloud, a solid baseline in web application testing will greatly assist you on this journey. This path covers key topics that you need to understand for web application testing.

_Sections:_

1. Authentication
2. Injection Attacks
3. Advanced Server-Side Attacks
4. Advanced Client-Side Attacks
5. HTTP Request Smuggling


## Web Application Red Teaming
So you have decided to venture into web application testing? You know the basics, you can find the vulnerabilities, but it still feels like something is missing. What you need, is a good exploitation methodology! Rather than simply finding vulnerabilities and calling it a day, this learning path teaches you the principles of practical exploitation.

_Sections:_
1. Cryptographic Failures
2. Custom Tooling
3. Chaining Vulnerabilities
4. Bypassing WAF
5. Attacking LLMs
